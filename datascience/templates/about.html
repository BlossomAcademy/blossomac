        <p>Global emerging markets represent an untapped, vast opportunity for many businesses and organizations, however, the lack of credible consumer and market data often makes it difficult to address societal challenges. A recent surge in digital innovations is changing this while creating opportunities for data-driven talent.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, most companies cannot find nearly enough analysts and scientists to analyze the data collected for strategic decision making. Africa, meanwhile, has the youngest population and 7 of the 10 fastest growing internet populations in the world.</p>
        <p>We founded Blossom Academy to create a pathway where top talent from West Africa with diverse academic backgrounds can build the knowledge, skills, and abilities to reach their potential as data-driven professionals and leverage those talents to contribute to the growth of their respective economies.</p>

        <p>While working as a consultant on Wall Street, founder Jeph Acheampong noticed a trend where his clients were using data to achieve a competitive advantage. Concurrently, his conversations with high growth startups across Africa uncovered a need for analyzing data to inform strategic decision-making.<p>
        <p>Yet there is not enough supply of data scientists across Africa; positioning most businesses to outsource projects abroad and pay above market rate. This observation confirmed a necessity to launch the first data science academy in Ghana, immediately welcoming over 950 applicants.</p>
