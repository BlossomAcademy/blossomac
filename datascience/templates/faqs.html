<p class="font-weight-bold">What is the application process like?</p>
<p>There are 4 stages in our application process:
Rigorous aptitude test 
Two case studies 
Programming proficiency test 
Individual Interview</p>

<p class="font-weight-bold">Can I apply if I do not have a college degree?</p>
<p>Blossom Academy is a program focused on empowering motivated and ambitious people to launch into a meaningful career. While we have tailored the program to those who have completed a college degree, we also welcome final year and masters students. All backgrounds are welcome however, we have a strong preference for applicants with backgrounds in STEM fields.</p> 

<p class="font-weight-bold">Can I re-apply to Blossom Academy if I’m not admitted the first time?</p>
<p>Yes. Applicants are welcome to reapply to Blossom Academy if they are not admitted during a previous application period. We believe that talent and skills can improve over time, so repeat applicants are treated the same as first-time applicants.</p>

<p class="font-weight-bold">Can I participate in Blossom Academy if I'm from outside of Accra-Ghana?</p>
<p>Yes, but you need to be located within 50 miles of Accra during the Blossom Academy year and be authorized to work after training.</p>

<p class="font-weight-bold">If I'm accepted, how do I confirm my spot?</p>
<p>Upon notification of acceptance, all students have two weeks to confirm their spot. This is done by signing your employment agreement and submitting a $250 non-refundable deposit (to be clear this is not an additional charge, it is instead credited towards your first paycheck).</p>

<p class="font-weight-bold">What are the specific skill sets I'll learn as part of this program?</p>
<p>Blossom Academy focuses on teaching you relevant hard and leadership skills needed to thrive in any 21st century career. Some of the hard skills include analytics and storytelling, statistical analysis, random forests, predictive modeling, and SQL. 
Leadership skills include persuasive communication, giving and receiving feedback, time management, critical problem solving and team dynamics. In addition, you’ll complete Blossom Academy with deep training in your major.</p>

<p class="font-weight-bold">How much of the program is taught online vs. offline?</p>
<p>About 70% of the program is taught online however, you'll primarily engage with your peers in real-time virtual classrooms. The other 30% involves working together in person, which you'll do at orientation and biweekly meetups. You will also participate in frequent virtual and in-person collaboration sessions with your project teammates.</p>

<p class="font-weight-bold">How is the Blossom Academy program structured?</p>
<p>Our program requires your participation as a full-time student, but the time commitment should enable you to complete your academics or hold a separate part-time job if you choose.
Your instructors will be industry experts and leading practitioners.
70% of time on team-based projects.
30% of time in classes and independent projects.
Biweekly in-person meetups for networking and skill development.
Team-based project sprints with classmates on real company challenges.
Week-long breaks between each 10-12 week quarter.
Social gatherings organized to have fun and build lifelong friendships.</p>

<p class="font-weight-bold">Is Blossom Academy an accredited university?</p>
<p>No, we are not an accredited university as this would limit our abilities to create a dynamic curriculum that evolves just as fast as the needs of the industries in which we’re training students for jobs. The rules of traditional accreditation focus more on seat time than actual career preparation, and we believe the most important credential we can deliver is not a piece of paper, but rather working with leading companies.</p>

<p class="font-weight-bold">Does my college credit transfer to Blossom Academy?</p>
<p>No, but this should have no effect on your Blossom Academy experience. Our admissions process allows us to assess your prior learnings.</p>

<p class="font-weight-bold">How many students are in each program?</p>
<p>There are approximately 25 students per Blossom Academy program year.</p>

<p class="font-weight-bold">How can I get the most out of my Blossom Academy experience?</p>
<p>The best way to get the most out of your Blossom Academy experience is to fully commit to the program and to your personal development. The more you put into it, the more you’ll reap the rewards. Do the assigned pre-work, participate actively in class discussions, and contribute to group projects. Most important of all, trust the process.</p>

<p class="font-weight-bold">Do I have to live within my cohort’s city to attend Blossom Academy?</p>
<p>The only requirement is that you live within 50 miles of your program's city. Blossom Academy is designed to enable you to live wherever within that area is convenient and affordable, as long as you have easy access to the city to attend your cohort’s orientation, bi weekly meetups and excursions at local companies at the end of the program.</p>

<p class="font-weight-bold">How often am I expected to be in my program's city?</p>
<p>You and your peers will meet for a two-day kickoff orientation, twice per month for meetups, and again at graduation. We additionally encourage you to get together as needed to better collaborate on group projects and build close friendships with your classmates.</p>

<p class="font-weight-bold">Do you provide housing or meal plans?</p>
<p>No, we do not provide nor require specific housing and meal plans while attending Blossom Academy. This is done intentionally so students are not burdened by financial commitments they are unable to meet. We leave it to our students to manage the costs of their own housing and meals, just as they will once they start their careers. You may live wherever you'd like as long as you are within 50 miles of your program's city. We also encourage you to eat healthy. Strong nutrition leads to strong minds. What we do support you with are data bundles during your training periods.</p>

<p class="font-weight-bold">What jobs will this program prepare me for?</p>
<p>At Blossom Academy, we train you for fulfilling, limitless careers. Our first major, Data Science + Machine Learning, will provide you with the skills and foundation to thrive as a consultant in any of our partner companies where information is used to make better business decisions. These include analyst positions across many industries and departments, as well open roles in high-growth sectors such as Healthcare, Professional Services, Fintech, E-Commerce and more.</p>

<p class="font-weight-bold">How is employment at Blossom Academy structured?</p>
<p>After training, graduates work as contractors at Blossom Academy under a 2-year contract, where you will earn an above-average salary compared to other university graduates.</p>
